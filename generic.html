									<h1> Session 00 <br /></h1>
									<p>Get to know me and what I’m about. In this post, I’ll be sharing a bit about my background, my passions, and the values that drive me. Whether you're curious about my journey, my projects, or just want to understand what makes me tick, here this goes.

								<p>"Where is my home?" young Busisiwe questioned. Having moved to the U.A.E. at the tender age of three, my life became immersed in the lifestyle and customs of this nation. Initially, my future was far from centered on technology and computer science; my interests evolved from a deep-rooted identity crisis. Seeking a connection between my South African heritage and life in the U.A.E., technology soon became an essential aspect of my aspirations. Every summer(Winter in South Africa), my family journeyed to South Africa and returned to the U.A.E., where I grew increasingly fascinated by the evolving travel processes—facial recognition security tunnels and the introduction of AI technology sparked my curiosity year after year. Meanwhile, my elder brothers in South Africa would indulge my lively spirit for a few days before returning to their routines of university and computer work.

									As I observed them dismantling computers for cleaning, typing codes, and programming for hours, I dove deeper into the fundamentals of technological innovation, uncovering a new language that harmonized with my evolving interests. This journey fueled my ambitions not only to achieve my own dreams but also to provide opportunities for others.
									</p>
								<p>To introduce myself, I'm Busisiwe, currently in my second year at the University of Cape Town pursuing a BSc in Computer Science and Business Computing, with hopes of even more in future.
                                    
                                    I consider myself a well-rounded individual who enjoys exploring Cape Town and its surroundings with friends—whether jogging, surfing ( I can barely surf:/ ), listening to music, lounging by the beach, or indulging my passion for food (emphasis on eating, because I'm quite a big back). I've had my share of memorable experiences and look forward to many more.
                                    
                                    During this holiday break and onwards, I hope to share more of my projects and adventures here.The term 'logbook' comes from the numerous logbooks in the anime One Piece, a chronicle of brave exploits. Just as Zeff's logbook survived shipwrecks and adventures, I hope to document my own journey with equal resilience and enthusiasm.
                                    
                                    Oh, and yes, I love anime too!
